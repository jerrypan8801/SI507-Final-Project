Data Sources README

Data Source Description:
The dataset for the ChampionNetwork project was obtained from Kaggle,
a platform for predictive modelling and analytics competitions.
The dataset specifically used can be found at this URL: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datasnaek/league-of-legends/data.
It is provided in CSV format, which facilitates easy loading and manipulation using data processing libraries such as pandas.

Data Acquisition and Processing:
The dataset was directly downloaded from the aforementioned URL.
Once downloaded, the data was imported into the project using the pandas library function read_csv, which seamlessly reads CSV files into a DataFrame structure.
This initial step was crucial for subsequent data manipulation and analysis tasks.

Preprocessing Details:
An extensive data preprocessing phase was conducted to ensure the integrity and usability of the data.
The following steps were undertaken:
- Null Value Check: The dataset was scrutinized for any null values to prevent any data integrity issues during analysis. This step is vital for maintaining the robustness of the data-driven insights generated by the project.
- Data Understanding and Cleaning: Each of the 61 variables in the dataset was carefully examined to understand its type and role within the dataset. This included distinguishing between categorical and numerical data, which is critical for proper network graph construction and analysis.
- Variable Assessment: A comprehensive assessment of the variables was conducted to ensure that all data fields are correctly formatted and meaningful for the network analysis. This included adjusting data types and formatting as necessary to align with the analytical methods employed in the project.

Summary of Data:
The final dataset comprises 61 variables, each serving as a potential node or edge attribute in the network graph. These variables include champion IDs, team compositions, match outcomes, and other relevant metrics that are essential for a nuanced analysis of champion interactions and performance within the game.
The meticulous preprocessing and detailed understanding of each variable have equipped this project with a robust foundation for conducting meaningful network analysis that reflects the complexities and dynamics of champion interactions in League of Legends.
